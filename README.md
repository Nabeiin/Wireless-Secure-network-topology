# Wireless-Secure-network-topology
Complete design of the Secured network for enterprise topolgy
**Project Overview**
This repository contains the Packet Tracer network topology and configurations for a Wireless Network Security topology design. The project focuses on network segmentation, security enhancements, redundancy, and failover mechanisms to simulate an enterprise-grade secure wireless network.

**The topology includes:**
- VLAN Segmentation & Inter-VLAN Routing
- Redundant Core Switch (HSRP) for High Availability
- Firewall Security (Cisco ASA) with ACLs & NAT
- DHCP & DNS Servers for Dynamic Network Management
- Guest WiFi Segmentation with Restricted Access
- BGP Attack Simulation for Security Testing
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for Loop Prevention
